# Autoencoder for Dimension Reduction

## About
This repository contains a project for Deep Learning Final Exam (4th Semester). The goal is to build a Autoencoder model for dimension reduction in fashion MNIST image data.

## Dataset
The dataset used in this project is from [here](https://github.com/zalandoresearch/fashion-mnist). It is a Fashion MNIST dataset of 
Zalando's article imagesâ€”consisting of a training set of 60,000 examples and a test set of 10,000 examples. 
Each example is a 28x28 grayscale image, associated with a label from 10 classes. Since the data was so large,
we were told to use just 2 fashion outfit according to our gender and student ID. The data that i got is coat and sandal.

## Project Workflow
1. Import Data
2. Image Pre-processing (Normalization & Reshaping)
3. Modeling (Encoder & Decoder)
4. Model Modification
5. Evaluation
